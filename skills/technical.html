  <h3 class="aboutme">Problem Solving</h3>
  <p class="aboutcont">One of my favorite things to do is challenge myself and develop solutions for difficult problems. I enjoy building things (both physically and building software).</p>
  <h3 class="aboutme">Communication & Teamwork</h3>
  <p class="aboutcont">During the internship simulator program I've been placed in a position where it was necessary to adapt to the social environment. I struggled at first, but once I had completed my role as Scrum master and had done quite a bit of research into leadership / Scrum, as well as communication</p>
  <h3 class="aboutme">Desire to Improve</h3>
  <p class="aboutcont">The most important concept for me personally, is that no matter what you're doing, improve at it. Whether it's video games, communication, programming, or writing. The most important thing to me is working hard and improving things about myself, and rececntly I've felt the urge the urge to inspire other people to take the same approach to life.</p>
